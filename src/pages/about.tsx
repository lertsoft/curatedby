        This page / website / webapp was created because google does not offer a
        way for me to surface my saved places on maps on a native way. If you
        have a lot of places like me you want to go to those places or so I
        would hope but google does not tell you of them if you search, you need
        to purpusely look for your saved place. How it works now is that you
        need to find the saved icon a Green Marker if you know where it is but
        usually you don`t that is why you are using maps. So the second step is
        going to that area but again you might find it you might not but it will
        take a long time to do that. So the third option is just knowing the
        name and by that point the feature is kind of usuless because you are
        using the feature to outsource this things... Well you found your place,
        now you go and enjoy.
        <br></br>
        The way this app works is I could go to a neighborhood go my app press
        locate me and it show me every place save in that area. If I want to go
        to a restaurant I press the restaurarnt Icon get some quick info, and go
        there. I can easily surface the information that i need to go to the
        places that I have saved. The way I am using my data it will allow me to
        better understand the information that I had stored on google maps and
        act on it. <br></br>I would consider myself a poweruser of google maps
        as you can kind of assume from the paragraph above so when google
        offerings were not meeting my needs and standards I when out of my way
        to build that thing that i wanted and needed to better understand all my
        maps information.

        The website is pretty simple.<br></br>
        It has Icons to represent Bars, Restaurants, Japanese Restaurants, Parks
        | Hiking trails, Museums | Galleries, Clubs | Dance Venues, Cafes, and
        Places that I would like to travel to. <br></br>
        The data used on this maps came from my saved information from google.
        Google does not offer clean data or usuable actianable data at all so
        you have clean and structure it manually... it took me 5 days to do so.
        <br></br> It was built using Google Maps API`s, Next, React, Tailwind,
        and Typescript / Javascript. Pretty osverengineer but ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
        <br></br>
        This Website also works as a PWA or Progressive Web Application so tried
        it out! Install it on your phone üï∫üèΩ.
