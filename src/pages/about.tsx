        This page / website / webapp was created with the purpuse for me to
        understand better the information that I had stored on google maps.{' '}
        <br></br>I would consider myself a poweruser of google maps so when
        google offerings were not meeting my needs and standards I when out of
        my way to build that thing that i wanted and needed to better understand
        all my maps information.

        The website is pretty simple.<br></br>
        It was built using Google Maps API`s, Next, React, Tailwind, and
        Typescript / Javascript. Pretty osverengineer but ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.<br></br>
        This Website also works as a PWA or Progressive Web Application so tried
        it out!
