I am used to drinking south american beans (Brazilian, Costa rica and colombians) which are sweeter so maybe thats why the spiced up coffee was a bit much. The strawberry croissant is delish! TRY IT out. I am glad I try the coffee traditional specialty as it is fairly different and new to me, I would definetely go back and try a more traditional / regular coffee to actually taste the beans and find out the flavors of thee yemeni beans as I could not tell the coffee notes from this first experience. Loved the place the staff is really friendly and I would recommend going there and sitting down and enjoy the drink there as that would ensure you are getting the drinks as they are intended to be drank.",

The appetizers were \"Chef Kiss\", both Entrees were really good the vodka penne pasta was better than the bolognese pasta but that it for individuals to decide and the tiramisu was, repeat after me \"Chef Kiss\" Delicious.",

I love this place and it somewhat changed my perception on TAO Group restaurant as this blew my expectations off.
