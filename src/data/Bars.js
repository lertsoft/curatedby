          'This is suppose to be one of the 50 best bars in the world. This especifically is rank 47 here https://www.worlds50bestbars.com/the-list/employees-only.html Their drinks are good, the look and feel of the place is nice and cool. The bartenders are nice and explains the drinks to you if you ask. It is quite loud tho so be mindful of that. But I liked it, just do not get seasonal drinks if you would like to try their specialties. ',
